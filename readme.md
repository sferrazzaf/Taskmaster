This is a task manager and time tracker. It is designed to track all time spent during a work period. There is no downtime - if you are not working on a task, you are "working on" a break, or lunch, or some other event.

Tasks can be given estimated completion times, which can then be compared to actual completion time.

The app can also generate a report for a specific date showing what tasks were completed and how long they took.

REQUIREMENTS:
Django(==1.10.3)
